# Installation

This guide provides details on how to install `SnazzyList`.

## CocoaPods

The preferred method of installation for `SnazzyList` is using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

In order to use the latest release of the framework, add the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SnazzyList'
```

### Using `master`

Alternatively, you can use the latest version from the [`master` branch](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit/tree/master). This is what we use at [Luv.it](https://luv.it), so you can be confident that `master` is always stable and reliable.

```ruby
pod 'SnazzyList', :git => 'https://github.com/kbelter/SnazzyList.git', :branch => 'master'
```
